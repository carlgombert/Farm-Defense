Hey there, newcomer! Welcome to the farmstead. 
You'll want to start planting some crops. 
Use your hoe to get started.
-
Be warned, when night falls, the zombies arise.
They're hungry for crops and will try to
destroy everything you've worked for.
-
You can fortify your farm by purchasing walls
and turrets from the shop. 
They'll help keep those pesky zombies at bay.
-
And hey, don't forget to arm yourself.
The shop sells weapons and other useful items
that'll come in handy when defending your farm.
-
Good luck out there, friend.
I've got to run and tend to my own crops now.
May your harvests be bountiful!
