# Farm Defense
2D base defense and farming game written in Java using only standard Java libraries (Java AWT, Java sound API) 

## Motivation  
At the beginning of this project, when we decided to develop a game, we all shared a passion for programming and enjoyed games. However, we believed that the use of game engines in game development abstracted the process from its mathematical and programming foundations. We viewed computer games as real-time simulations where an imaginary world is modeled mathematically so that it can be manipulated by a computer. We felt that modern game engines hid too much under the hood and that, as programmers, if we were going to develop a game, we would do so using only standard Java libraries, building the engine ourselves along the way.  

## Challenges
This project grew much larger than we had originally anticipated and the largest challenge we faced in development was keeping it structured and organized as it continued to grow and include more features. We attempted to define a larger three part model of the system* and organize every program component into one of the three parts. Through this we gained valuable experience in design patterns and software organization.

## Outcome  
This project significantly enhanced the object oriented programming as well as Java skills of everyone involved. The programming that we were doing was very unconventional with no clear path to follow. We weren't just writing API endpoints or querying an SQL table; instead, we were implementing game mechanics that we had little experience with and for which no tutorials existed. This is why our close team environment was so essential as we constantly turned to each other for new ideas and perspectives.
